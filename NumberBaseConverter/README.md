# Numeral Converter: Binary ↔ Hexadecimal ↔ Decimal

This was a self-initiated project I built to help me understand how different numeral systems work in programming. I created it long before I took any formal CS courses.

## 🧠 Purpose

At the time, I couldn’t find an online calculator that allowed flexible inputs and conversions between **binary, hexadecimal, and decimal** — especially one that could add two values in any of those formats. So I made my own.

## 📌 Features

- Convert between:
  - Decimal ↔ Binary
  - Decimal ↔ Hexadecimal
  - Binary ↔ Hexadecimal
- Add two numbers of the same or different formats
- Input can be flexible: binary, hex, or decimal
- Fully console-based, using `Scanner` for input

## 🧪 Files

### 🔸 `darkbihexdec.java`
> My **original prototype** — fully built from scratch using pure logic, no helper libraries.  
> At the time I wrote this, I was just exploring how base conversions work under the hood.

- Logic-based implementation of base conversions
- Manual digit-by-digit conversion (e.g., hex-to-decimal without built-in functions)
- Preserved exactly as I originally wrote it — no polish, just raw functional code

### 🔹 `bihexdec.java`
> A **refactored version** I wrote later, with better structure, cleaner methods, and improved prompts.

- Same base functionality
- Improved code clarity
- Modular method design
- Clearer output and input messages

## 🚧 Notes

This wasn’t for a class — I just made it for myself to better understand how base conversions work. It helped me strengthen my logic, practice control structures, and think about error handling.

## 📷 Demo (optional)
Add a console screenshot or screen recording if you’d like.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to convert between numeral systems without shortcuts
- Why naming, modular design, and structure matter
- That building even small tools from scratch gives deeper understanding than tutorials
